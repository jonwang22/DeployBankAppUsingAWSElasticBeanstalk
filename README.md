# Deploying a Banking Application Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
## Purpose

We want to deploy our banking application for others to use. To do this, we are leveraging Jenkins and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Jenkins is our CI/CD tool that allows us to build and test our code hosted here in this Github repository.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a managed service that reduces our need to handle capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.
We can simply just deploy our app and be ready to go for our customers.
